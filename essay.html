A Place to Come Back to
What is New York? Nobody truly knows. We just live our lives expecting each day to be different.
As kids, we will be at school and then go our separate ways to the place we call home. It is different
for everyone. I walk down the block welcomed by the usuals smoking and occasionally playing games.
The deli that is dirty and crowded that I still get my junk food from. The shop I get my after school snacks from.
Then the dirty apartment that is always open and filled only with kids.
It is the same vibe every day. With all the shootings, stabbings, thefts, and attacks it is still my home.
On a crowded street, there is a small store. Within that small store, the store is always a line
that weaves through the store and extends outside. A line where people wait, talk and complain until their food comes.
Further inside is filled with dedicated hard workers who work around the clock preparing and cooking food. Making the
few special dishes for their regulars. A place I can rely on for food and a place I expect to be there for a long time.
In my area, there is always a place to be. Everything I need can be found within a few blocks.
There is everything I need but not everything I need I will buy there.
In other stores, there are better and cheaper things that will be worth the travel.
Worth the adventure into the unknown streets of Brooklyn that don’t light up at night.
The streets with dark tall buildings that block all forms of light.
The area that radiates during the day and drops to the lowest at night.
It is a beacon for tourists and locals to shop and dine. A new store that piques my interest.
A new restaurant I want to try. A new clothing store I would want to buy clothes from.
A new house I would dream of living in. A new area that would soon drift from my mind.
That area could be bright or dark depending on the time. In my neighborhood day or night the light from the restaurant.
It shines brightly around the clock welcoming everyone around the area. It’s a place we can go back to and cherish each moment that passes.
It is unlike many areas in New York City. Some places contain mostly Hispanics or Asians.
Some contain blacks and whites. While others are a melting pot consisting of all that were listed and even more.
A few are named after people and cultures that dwell within the area like Chinatown, Koreatown, and little Italy.
In those places, certain stores are expected to be there. Some areas don’t have labels and the stores that are within are a mystery.
The only way to find out what there is to be discovered.
A store on the next block could end up being your new favorite store you always go to in the future.
It could be a new first memory with someone special. A place that will remain close to your heart.
A place that can be there to lift your spirits and remember all the good times.
A place like a restaurant I enjoy, and I know it will not last forever.
I will not always have the chance to joke with the manager or to order a snack.
Every moment in the store gives me a jubilant feeling that I will cherish whenever I can.
The store is one of the only restaurants that were around when I was a kid.
The rest have been replaced with bars and that one is still standing tall.
